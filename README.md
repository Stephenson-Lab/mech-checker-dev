# Mech-Checker (A Chemical Structure Answer Checker) 
### A Browser-Based Molecular Structure Input and Validation Tool  
Designed for Blackboard Ultra and LMS Integration

## Version Description

This repository contains the simplest implementation of Mech-Checker. It is designed for embedding within a Blackboard Ultra Document via an iframe, with the question prompt provided separately in a preceding content block. The application validates the structure drawn by the student against the criteria defined in `tasks.js`, checking molecular formula, connectivity, and (where specified) stereochemistry. It is intended for straightforward formative structure verification rather than mechanism grading or advanced interaction.

---

## Purpose and Scope

The Chemical Structure Answer Checker is a lightweight, browser-based tool developed to support **formative self-assessment in chemistry education**.

It is intended exclusively for:

- Practice exercises  
- Self-guided learning  
- Low-stakes formative activities  
- Interactive tutorials  

This tool is **not designed for summative assessment, examinations, or high-stakes grading**.

All validation is performed client-side within the student's browser, and answer structures are visible in the repository source code. As such, it should not be used where secure answer concealment is required.

---

## Overview

Students draw a molecular structure using an embedded editor and receive immediate automated feedback regarding:

- Molecular formula correctness  
- Structural connectivity  
- Regiochemistry  
- Stereochemistry (when required)

The system is hosted using GitHub Pages and requires no server infrastructure.

## Accessing Specific Questions

Base URL:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker/

To open a specific question, append:

?task=N

Example:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker/?task=2

Important: The equals sign is required (`?task=2`, not `?task2`).

---

## Question Configuration

All questions are defined in:

tasks.js

Each question follows this structure:

window.TASKS = {
  1: {
    title: "Question 1",
    formula: "C5H10O3",
    requireStereo: true,
    prompt: "Draw the correct structure.",
    answersSmiles: [
      "C[C@H](O)CC(=O)OC"
    ]
  }
};

### Field Definitions

**title**  
Displayed heading for the question.

**formula**  
Expected molecular formula. Must match the calculated formula of the correct structure.

**requireStereo**  
`true` — stereochemistry must match exactly.  
`false` — stereochemistry is ignored.

**prompt**  
Optional instructional text shown to students.

**answersSmiles**  
An array of acceptable SMILES strings.  
Multiple entries may be included to allow equivalent or alternative correct answers (e.g., enantiomers).

---

## Adding a New Question

To add Question 11:

1. Open `tasks.js`
2. Add:

11: {
  title: "Question 11",
  formula: "C8H10O",
  requireStereo: false,
  prompt: "",
  answersSmiles: ["SMILES_HERE"]
},

3. Access via:

https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker/?task=11

---

## Blackboard Ultra Integration

To embed within a Blackboard Ultra Document:

<iframe
  src="https://stephenson-lab.github.io/mech-checker/?task=1"
  width="100%"
  height="820"
  style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:12px;"
  title="Chemical Structure Answer Checker – Question 1">
</iframe>

Each question should be embedded separately using its corresponding task number.

---

## Updating and Maintenance

If edits do not appear immediately:

- Perform a hard refresh  
  - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R  
  - macOS: Cmd + Shift + R  

- Alternatively, increment the version parameter in `index.html`:

<script src="./tasks.js?v=2"></script>

Increase the version number after changes.

---

## Security and Assessment Disclaimer

This tool:

- Performs all validation client-side  
- Stores correct answers visibly in `tasks.js`  
- Does not conceal answer data  
- Does not provide secure authentication or grading controls  

Therefore, it is suitable only for **formative, self-directed learning activities** and should not be used for graded examinations or high-stakes assessment.
